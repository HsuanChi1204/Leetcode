## Two Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays, Hashing
Content: 
- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order.

## ðŸ“– Understand 

### ðŸ“Œ Step-by-step Process:
- **Read the question out loud**.
- **Clarify the following details**:
  - *Can each number only be used once?* No
  - *Can the input list be empty?* is it possible? No
  - *Will the numbers in the array duplicate?* No
  - *Can the numbers be positive, negative, or both?* Both
  - *Is there any requirement on time/space complexity?* No
  - *Can I use Python to solve the problem or are there any languages you prefer me to use?* Python is preferred
  - *Do you want me to write pseudocode first or just code the result out?* I'll write pseudocode first
- **Write down key rules clearly**: e.g., distinct integers, ascending order.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Happy Case:**
  ```python
  Input: nums = [-10, 0, 1], target = -10
  Output: [0, 1]
  ```

- **Edge Case:**
  ```python
  Input: nums = [1, 1, 1], target = 2
  Output: [0, 1] or [1, 2]  # If multiple valid pairs exist
  ```

## Match
Identify suitable **Data Structures** or **Algorithms** if you're stuck.

- Can I solve this with a **List**? Usually sequential and O(n) for lookups.
- Is a **Set** helpful? Fast lookups, but unordered.
- Consider a **Hashtable (Dictionary)** for O(1) lookups.

**Example Thought Process:**
- Using a List, checking existence is O(n) â†’ inefficient.
- Hashtable provides O(1) lookup â†’ ideal for this problem.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Data Structure:
- Hashtable (dictionary): stores numbers as keys, and their indices as values for O(1) lookups.

---

## Plan (Pseudocode)

1. Create a dictionary (`twoSum`) to store numbers as keys and their indices as values.
2. Iterate through `nums`:
    - Calculate the required number (`find = target - num`).
    - Check if `find` exists in the dictionary:
      - If found and indices differ, return both indices.

### Pseudocode Example:
```pseudo
Process:
    FOR each index, num in nums:
        Calculate diff = target - num
        IF diff exists in nums_map:
            RETURN [nums_map[diff], current_index]
        ELSE:
            Add num:index to nums_map
    IF no solution found:
        RETURN empty list
```

## Implement (Write the actual code)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        nums_map = {}
        for index, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in nums_map:
                return [nums_map[diff], index]
            else:
                nums_map[num] = index
        return []
```

---

## Review
- Carefully review your implementation by checking:
  - Correctness of variable naming.
  - Constraints handling.
  - Edge cases coverage (negative numbers, duplicates, sorted order).

---

## Evaluate
- Time Complexity: O(n), because I iterate the nums list once
- Space Complexity: O(n), because I use a dictionary to store the number I checked and its Index

---

## Optimize

- I can optimize the space complexity by using a list to store the result instead of a dictionary  

---

## Evaluate (Self-assessment)
- Did I clearly understand the question and constraints?
- Was my solution efficient in terms of time and space?
- Did I consider edge cases and validate my solution adequately?
- Can my code readability or structure improve?
